# WHEEL REBUILDER

**What is this?**

This is a minimal desktop app (currenty; iOS and browser form to come soon) that is used to help people rebuild their wheels. We all find it hard to calculate the correct specs once we relip or rebarrel our wheels, with this small app it makes it simple by just entered the required information. Save yourself alot of time; dont sit there with pen and paper calculating the size by hand. I mean, you can if you want. Have fun with that.

This was created with Electron.

Future platforms include web brower and iOS. No android cause android sucks. 

## To Use

Enter the values for your wheels (diameter, width, offset, lip size and barrel size) and then enter the desired lip size and barrel size that you want to rebuild with and then hit rebuild.

If you want to relip only, enter the same barrel size.

The lip and barrel size and offset are dead set required because each wheel face is created different depending on disk size for brake clearance.
